# Slurm Code Usage Analysis (scua)
#Â 
# Analyse code usage from Slurm. Relies on the scua.py 
# program to do the analysis. This wrapper script runs the
# correct sacct command to extract the data from Slurm and
# passes it to scua.py. If you already have the data, you
# should use the scua.py program directly.
